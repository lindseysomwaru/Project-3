## **Overview**
The following program finds the longest common subsequence given two String sequences of length 6. The LCS algorithm is implemented using a bottom-up approach. The program uses one void helper method, *lcs(String s1, String s2, int length)*, and a main method.

## **Running the File**
The user will first be prompted to enter two strings of length six. Only strings with length six can will be accepted; if a string of any other length is entered, an error message will appear, and the program will terminate. Once the user enters two valid strings, the program will determine the LCS and its length. The two original strings, the LCS, and the length of the LCS will be printed.
